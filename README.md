# list
A collection of experimental list manipulation functions for Flux code blocks. These are candidates for addition to the Flux block library. 

### `chop(list, chunkSize)`
Chop a list into chunks of a given size.

### `unflatten(flattened, structure)`
Return a previously flattened list to its original structure. Useful when applying a laced operation on elements of a multi-dimensional array while preserving its structure.
